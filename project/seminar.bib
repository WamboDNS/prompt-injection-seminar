abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into applications, with versatile functionalities that can be easily modulated via natural language prompts. So far, it was assumed that the user is directly prompting the LLM. But, what if it is not the user prompting? We show that LLM-Integrated Applications blur the line between data and instructions and reveal several new attack vectors, using Indirect Prompt Injection, that enable adversaries to remotely (i.e., without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved at inference time. We derive a comprehensive taxonomy from a computer security perspective to broadly investigate impacts and vulnerabilities, including data theft, worming, information ecosystem contamination, and other novel security risks. We then demonstrate the practical viability of our attacks against both real-world systems, such as Bing Chat and code-completion engines, and GPT-4 synthetic applications. We show how processing retrieved prompts can act as arbitrary code execution, manipulate the application's functionality, and control how and if other APIs are called. Despite the increasing reliance on LLMs, effective mitigations of these emerging threats are lacking. By raising awareness of these vulnerabilities, we aim to promote the safe and responsible deployment of these powerful models and the development of robust defenses that protect users from potential attacks.},

However, limited research has been conducted to study its vulnerabilities emerging from malicious user interaction. By proposing TrojanSQL, a backdoor-based SQL injection framework for text-to-SQL systems, we show how state-of-the-art text-to-SQL parsers can be easily misled to produce harmful SQL statements that can invalidate user queries or compromise sensitive information about the database. The study explores two specific injection attacks, namely $\textit{boolean-based injection}$ and $\textit{union-based injection}$, which use different types of triggers to achieve distinct goals in compromising the parser. Experimental results demonstrate that both medium-sized models based on fine-tuning and LLM-based parsers using prompting techniques are vulnerable to this type of attack, with attack success rates as high as 99{\%} and 89{\%}, respectively. We hope that this study will raise more concerns about the potential security risks of building natural language interfaces to databases.",

abstract = {Given how the "patching treadmill" plays a central role for enabling sites to counter emergent security concerns, it behooves the security community to understand the patch development process and characteristics of the resulting fixes. Illumination of the nature of security patch development can inform us of shortcomings in existing remediation processes and provide insights for improving current practices. In this work we conduct a large-scale empirical study of security patches, investigating more than 4,000 bug fixes for over 3,000 vulnerabilities that affected a diverse set of 682 open-source software projects. For our analysis we draw upon the National Vulnerability Database, information scraped from relevant external references, affected software repositories, and their associated security fixes. Leveraging this diverse set of information, we conduct an analysis of various aspects of the patch development life cycle, including investigation into the duration of impact a vulnerability has on a code base, the timeliness of patch development, and the degree to which developers produce safe and reliable fixes. We then characterize the nature of security fixes in comparison to other non-security bug fixes, exploring the complexity of different types of patches and their impact on code bases.Among our findings we identify that: security patches have a lower footprint in code bases than non-security bug patches; a third of all security issues were introduced more than 3 years prior to remediation; attackers who monitor open-source repositories can often get a jump of weeks to months on targeting not-yet-patched systems prior to any public disclosure and patch distribution; nearly 5\% of security fixes negatively impacted the associated software; and 7\% failed to completely remedy the security hole they targeted.},

As web applications generally adopt input validation and sanitization routines to prevent web security risks, in this paper, we propose a set of static code attributes that represent the characteristics of these routines for predicting the two most common web application vulnerabilities—SQL injection and cross site scripting. In our experiments, vulnerability predictors built from the proposed attributes detected more than 80\% of the vulnerabilities in the test subjects at low false alarm rates.},

The basic concept of role-based access control (RBAC) is that permissions are associated with roles, and users are made members of appropriate roles, thereby acquiring the roles' permissions. This idea has been around since the advent of multi-user computing. Until recently, however, RBAC has received little attention from the research community. This chapter describes the motivations, results, and open issues in recent MAC research. The chapter focuses on four areas. First, RBAC is a multidimensional concept that can range from very simple at one extreme to quite complex and sophisticated at the other. This presents problems in coming up with a definitive model of RBAC. We see how this impasse is resolved by having a family of models which can accommodate all these variations. Second, we discuss how RBAC can be used to manage itself. Recent models developed for this purpose are presented. Third, the flexibility of RBAC can be demonstrated in many ways. Here we show how RBAC can be configured to enforce different variations of classical lattice-based mandatory access controls. Fourth, we describe a conceptual three-tier architecture for specification and enforcement of RBAC. The chapter concludes with a discussion of open issues in RBAC.}

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

abstract = {Phishing email attacks have been around for fifteen years but they are still among the top security risks faced by organisations. The most common approach to mitigate these attacks is employees' education and awareness. Employees' awareness on phishing attacks is achieved by embedded training that educate employees when they fall for the attack. However, the effectiveness of embedded training in workplace settings is uncertain given the large number of employees that remain vulnerable to phishing email attacks. Similarly, the role of persuasion techniques in making employees vulnerable to phishing attacks is yet to be investigated in the workplace settings. Therefore, in this paper we investigate which persuasion technique between authority and urgency is more effective in making employees susceptible to phishing, the relation between employees' susceptibility and their demographic data, and the effectiveness of embedded training in reducing employees' susceptibility to phishing attacks. To this end, we conducted a real phishing study with 191 employees of an Italian company. We found that employees were more vulnerable to phishing attacks when urgency principle was exploited. The study also showed no significant effect of employees' demographic data on susceptibility to phishing. Embedded training was perceived as effective by employees but it did not reduce their susceptibility to phishing.},

abstract = {Context
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that affects web applications. It occurs due to improper or lack of sanitization of user inputs. The security vulnerability caused many problems for users and server applications.
Objective
To conduct a systematic literature review on the studies done on XSS vulnerabilities and attacks.
Method
We followed the standard guidelines for systematic literature review as documented by Barbara Kitchenham and reviewed a total of 115 studies related to cross-site scripting from various journals and conference proceedings.
Results
Research on XSS is still very active with publications across many conference proceedings and journals. Attack prevention and vulnerability detection are the areas focused on by most of the studies. Dynamic analysis techniques form the majority among the solutions proposed by the various studies. The type of XSS addressed the most is reflected XSS.
Conclusion
XSS still remains a big problem for web applications, despite the bulk of solutions provided so far. There is no single solution that can effectively mitigate XSS attacks. More research is needed in the area of vulnerability removal from the source code of the applications before deployment.}

Threat modeling is proposed as a solution for secure application development and system security evaluations. Its aim is to be more proactive and make it more difficult for attackers to accomplish their malicious intents. However, threat modeling is a domain that lacks common ground. What is threat modeling, and what is the state-of-the-art work in this field? To answer these questions, this article presents a review of threat modeling based on systematic queries in four leading scientific databases. This is the first systematic literature review on threat modeling to the best of our knowledge. 176 articles were assessed, and 54 of them were selected for further analysis. We identified three separate clusters: (1) articles making a contribution to threat modeling, e.g., introducing a new method, (2) articles using an existing threat modeling approach, and (3) introductory articles presenting work related to the threat modeling process. The three clusters were analyzed in terms of a set of criteria, for instance: Is the threat modeling approach graphical or formal? Is it focused on a specific attack type and application? Is the contribution validated empirically or theoretically? We observe from the results that, most threat modeling work remains to be done manually, and there is limited assurance of their validations. The results can be used for researchers and practitioners who want to know the state-of-the-art threat modeling methods, and future research directions are discussed.}
